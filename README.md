# Analyze A/B Test Results
This is a Udacity nano degree project to analyze A/B Test Results for an e-commerce website. The objective of the analysis is to help the company understand if they should implement new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the project longer to make their decision.

## Software and Packages:
Jupyter Notebook  
Pandas  
Numpy  
random  
matplotlib  
statsmodels  

## What I did
Probability  
A/B Test  
Regression  

## A/B Test 
Null hypothesis: Old page has better conversion  

Alternate hypothesis: New page has better conversion  

## Conclusions
The large p-value suggests the null hypothesis is true. We can conclude that there is no clear evidence that new page will lead to better conversions. The recommendation, therefore, is to keep the old page.
